# ZipBomb

### This zipBomb script was made using the [42.zip](https://www.unforgettable.dk/) as model.

It will generate a file that contains 16 zipped files, which again contains 16 zipped files, which again contains 16 zipped files, which again contains 16 zipped, which again contains 16 zipped files, which contain 1 file, with the size of 4.3GB.

16 x 4294967295       = 68.719.476.720 (68GB)

16 x 68719476720      = 1.099.511.627.520 (1TB)

16 x 1099511627520    = 17.592.186.040.320 (17TB)

16 x 17592186040320   = 281.474.976.645.120 (281TB)

16 x 281474976645120  = 4.503.599.626.321.920 (4,5PB)
